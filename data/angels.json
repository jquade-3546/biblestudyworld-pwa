  "body": "God has often sent angel messengers to warn and instruct His people about important future events. Before God destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah, He sent angels to warn Lot and his family to get out. When Daniel had visions about last-day prophecies, angels interpreted the visions for him. When John the Baptist was to be born, the angel Gabriel was sent to tell the father what to name the child and how to take care of John. But who are the angels? Where do they come from and what is their work?<br><br>Psalms 8:4,5 God created man distinctly different from the angels. We are a little lower order of being than they are. Angels have powers and capabilities that we do not have.<br><br>Matthew 28:2,3 Even just one angel has tremendous power, as was seen here.<br><br>Revelation 5:11 There are millions and millions of angels.<br><br>Matthew 25:31 All the holy angels will come with Jesus when He returns to gather His people.<br><br>Revelation 22:8 As mighty and holy as angels are, we are not supposed to worship them! Yet many today are doing just that.<br><br>Hebrews 1:13 Angels are spirits sent to guide and warn believers. Our salvation is their main goal.<br><br>Luke 2:8 Angels were joyful at the birth of Christ.<br><br>Luke 15:10 Angels also are joyful and rejoice when even one sinner repents and is born again.<br><br>Psalm 34:7 Angels surround and protect those who trust in God.<br><br>Psalm 91:9-11 Why do God's people need such protection? They need it because there is more than one kind of angel! All angels are not the good servants of God.<br><br>Revelation 12:7-9 Satan and his angels fell from heaven to earth. They are now fallen angels, no longer in harmony with God. On earth, they continue the war that started in heaven. But many people fail to see that we are all caught up in this spiritual battle.<br><br>2 Corinthians 11:14 Satan and his angels often appear to us as if they were holy angels of light.<br><br>2 Corinthians 11:15 Satan's ministers appear to be ministers of righteousness, but they are not. They mix truth with error. How can we know if the spirits that come to us are from God or Satan?<br><br>Psalm 103:20 God's angels obey God and teach things in harmony with the Bible. That's how we can know they are from God.<br><br>Galatians 1:8 If we don't know our Bibles we are in grave danger of listening to the wrong voices and becoming confused.<br><br>Revelation 12:12 The devil wants to destroy as many people as possible. He is angry because he knows he does not have much time left to do his terrible work of destruction.<br><br>Revelation 14:6 An angel is flying in the sky with the everlasting gospel, a message so important every person on the planet must hear it.<br><br>Revelation 14:14-16 After this gospel message is preached, Jesus will come. Those that are ready will meet Him in the air as He comes with clouds. A similar message was preached before Christ's first coming.<br><br>Revelation 14:6,7 Why is the angel so in earnest? He knows what will happen if we do not heed this message! The first part of the message is a warning that the judgment hour is come. That means the judgment is going on at this time, and this message is being given before the second coming of Jesus. The first part of the gospel message at the end tells us we need to get our houses in order.<br><br>Daniel 7:8-10 Daniel saw the judgment in session, the books opened. The angels know this and that's why they warn us. Those without Christ have no hope, but those with Christ have every hope.<br><br>1 John 5:12 He that has the Son, Jesus, has life; but he that does not have Jesus does not have life.<br><br>Daniel 7:13,14 Jesus represents His followers in the judgment. God's angels bring the gospel, but Satan's angels deceive.<br><br>1 Timothy 4:1 In the last days there will be seducing spirits and doctrines of devils. Evil angels seduce people, and few realize that the devil has a doctrine or teaching. It is truth mixed with error. Because of this danger, God sends another angel message.<br><br>Revelation 14:8 This angel warns that Babylon is fallen. Babylon was where the Tower of Babel was. Man tried to make his own way to get to heaven without accepting God's way. In the last days, Babylon represents religions that teach you not to take the Bible literally. People hear this and become drunk and confused.<br><br>Revelation 18:1,2,7 Fallen Babylon glorifies herself and puts her own ideas where God's ideas should be.<br><br>Revelation 14:9,10 Babylon tries to get everyone to follow her by enforcing the mark of the beast.<br><br>Jeremiah 18:1-4 Just as the potter's vessel was marred, we have been marred by sin. God made man perfect, but Satan has tried to destroy each one of us. But though the clay is marred, He does not cast us away.<br><br>Jeremiah 18:4-6 Jesus has the power to remake us into beautiful vessels for His Spirit to live in. All He needs is your permission to remake you. Won't you allow Him to do that? No matter how your life has been marred, no matter how low you feel you have sunk, no matter how unworthy you feel, Jesus Christ wants to remake you. It may be that you know you need the power of Christ in your life, maybe you have never given your life to Christ, maybe you see that your life is marred and you want to yield to the power of Jesus to save you and remake you. If you yield and remain yielded, He will transform your life completely!"
